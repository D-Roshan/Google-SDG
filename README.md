ABOUT BACKEND:

The python script mines data from the web then appends the data to a json file.
Firebase realtime database was initially used to upload the json data but the database was disabled due to billing problems, so,
a free hosting service was used to host the generated json file from the python script. Firebase codes have been commented for references.
